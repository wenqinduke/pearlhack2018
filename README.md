# Contactor 

This is a project created @ PearlHack (2018). 

Contactor is a mobile IOS app that allows a user to scan a name card by either uploading an image to the app, or taking a picture. 
With an existing name-card image, users are able to extract information from the name card (e.g. Name, telephone number, email address, etc) and save it to IOS Contacts. 
In addition, after successfully saved into contacts, users are able to send a text message to the person on the name card, with custom text to let that newly added contact know user's number or any other information.
